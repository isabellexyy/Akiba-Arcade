# Akiba Arcade
*The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Marketplace on XRPL*

Mobile gaming is a rapidly expanding industry. In 2023, Tencent’s Honour of Kings garnered a remarkable $1.48 billion, PUBG Mobile generated $1.14 billion, and Genshin Impact achieved $956.9 million in revenue. Mobile games featuring RPG elements and gacha mechanics often increase in value over time due to the accumulation of in-game assets. Consequently, there's a growing demand among players looking to depart from these games to monetize their accounts, which might include accumulated tokens, rare skins, or other exclusive benefits. Concurrently, new players interested in joining well-established games seek these enriched accounts to gain a head start. This dynamic fosters a market for buying and selling game accounts.
